# Verification Reason and Balance Match Display Fix

**Date:** October 11, 2025
**Issue:** Balance Match and Verification Reason were in summary table but not visible in UI

## Problem

The user reported that `balance_match` and `verification_reason` were stored in the Summary table but not displayed in the UI. The main UI table in `index.html` was missing these columns entirely.

## Root Cause

**Two issues were identified:**

1. **Backend API Issue (PRIMARY)**: The `/api/v1/unified-list` endpoint was NOT selecting `verification_reason` from the `unified_statements` view. The SQL query only included `verification_status` and `balance_match`, but completely omitted `verification_reason`. This meant the data was never being sent to the frontend in the JSON response.

2. **Frontend Display Issue**: The main UI file (`backend/app/templates/index.html`) was missing the Balance Match and Verification Reason columns in the table headers and JavaScript rendering code.

## Solution

The fix required changes to both the backend API and the frontend template.

### 1. Fixed Backend API: `backend/app/api/v1/statements.py`

**Added `verification_reason` to the SQL SELECT query:**

Before:
```sql
SELECT
    ...
    verification_status,
    balance_match,
    duplicate_count,
    ...
```

After:
```sql
SELECT
    ...
    verification_status,
    verification_reason,  -- ADDED
    balance_match,
    duplicate_count,
    ...
```

**Updated row-to-dict mapping** to include verification_reason at index 9 and shifted all subsequent indices:
```python
'verification_status': row[8],
'verification_reason': row[9],  # ADDED
'balance_match': row[10],       # Was row[9], shifted by 1
'duplicate_count': row[11],     # Was row[10], shifted by 1
# ... all subsequent fields shifted by 1
```

### 2. Updated Frontend Template: `backend/app/templates/index.html`

The fix involved adding two new columns to the statements table and creating JavaScript helper functions to render the data properly.

#### A. Added Column Headers (lines 454-456)
```html
<th>Balance Match</th>
<th>Verification</th>
<th>Verification Reason</th>
```

#### B. Created Helper Functions

**Balance Match Badge Function (lines 719-730):**
```javascript
function getBalanceMatchBadge(item) {
    if (item.processing_status === 'IMPORTED') {
        return '<span style="color: #888;">Not Processed</span>';
    }
    if (item.balance_match === 'Success') {
        return '<span class="status-pass">Success</span>';
    } else if (item.balance_match === 'Failed') {
        return '<span class="status-fail">Failed</span>';
    }
    return '<span style="color: #888;">-</span>';
}
```

**Verification Reason Function (lines 747-760):**
```javascript
function getVerificationReason(item) {
    if (item.processing_status === 'IMPORTED') {
        return '<span style="color: #888;">-</span>';
    }
    if (item.verification_reason) {
        // Truncate to 50 characters
        const reason = item.verification_reason.length > 50
            ? item.verification_reason.substring(0, 50) + '...'
            : item.verification_reason;
        return `<span title="${item.verification_reason}">${reason}</span>`;
    }
    return '<span style="color: #888;">-</span>';
}
```

**Features:**
- Shows first 50 characters of verification_reason
- Adds "..." if text is longer than 50 characters
- Full text available in tooltip (HTML `title` attribute on hover)
- Shows "-" in gray if no verification reason exists
- Balance Match shows "Success" (green) or "Failed" (red)
- Shows "Not Processed" for statements that haven't been processed yet

#### C. Updated Table Row Generation (lines 687-689)
Added the three new columns to each table row:
```javascript
<td>${balanceMatchBadge}</td>
<td>${verificationBadge}</td>
<td>${verificationReason}</td>
```

#### D. Updated Colspan Values
Changed from `colspan="20"` to `colspan="22"` in all empty state messages (lines 471, 652, 715) to account for the two new columns.

## Table Structure

The statements table now has **22 columns**:

1. Checkbox (selection)
2. Run ID
3. Provider (Airtel/MTN)
4. Account Number
5. RM Name
6. Rows (transaction count)
7. Imported (timestamp)
8. Status (IMPORTED/PROCESSED)
9. Actions (Process/Download buttons)
10. **Balance Match** (NEW - Success/Failed badge)
11. **Verification** (PASS/FAIL/WARNING badge)
12. **Verification Reason** (NEW - visible text with truncation)
13. Duplicates (count)
14. Balance Diff Changes
15. Balance Diff Ratio
16. Calculated Balance
17. Statement Balance
18. Title (PDF metadata)
19. Author (PDF metadata)
20. Producer (PDF metadata)
21. Created At (PDF metadata)
22. Modified At (PDF metadata)

## UI Display Examples

### Example 1: Successful Verification
- **Balance Match:** Success (green)
- **Verification:** PASS (green)
- **Verification Reason:** "Balance matches and no duplicates detected"

### Example 2: Balance Mismatch
- **Balance Match:** Failed (red)
- **Verification:** FAIL (red)
- **Verification Reason:** "Balance mismatch: calculated=1050000.00, state..."
  - (Full text on hover: "Balance mismatch: calculated=1050000.00, statement=1049950.00")

### Example 3: Duplicate Warning
- **Balance Match:** Success (green)
- **Verification:** WARNING (yellow)
- **Verification Reason:** "Found 3 duplicate transactions"

### Example 4: Not Processed
- **Balance Match:** Not Processed (gray)
- **Verification:** - (gray)
- **Verification Reason:** - (gray)

## Changes Summary

### Files Modified:

#### 1. **`backend/app/api/v1/statements.py`** (CRITICAL FIX)
   - Added `verification_reason` to the SELECT query in `/unified-list` endpoint (line 135)
   - Updated row mapping to include `verification_reason` at index 9 (line 170)
   - Shifted all subsequent row indices by 1 (lines 171-182)

   **Why this was needed**: The API was querying the `unified_statements` view but NOT selecting the `verification_reason` column, so it was never being sent to the frontend. This is why the field showed as blank.

#### 2. **`backend/app/templates/index.html`**
   - Added "Balance Match" column header (line 454)
   - Added "Verification Reason" column header (line 456)
   - Created `getBalanceMatchBadge()` function (lines 719-730)
   - Created `getVerificationReason()` function (lines 747-760)
   - Updated table row generation to include balance match and verification reason (lines 687-689)
   - Updated colspan from 20 to 22 in all empty state messages (lines 471, 652, 715)

## Data Flow

The complete data flow for displaying verification information:

```
1. Database:
   └── Summary Table
       ├── balance_match (Success/Failed)
       ├── verification_status (PASS/FAIL/WARNING)
       └── verification_reason (detailed text explanation)

2. Backend API (/api/v1/unified-list):
   ├── Queries both Metadata and Summary tables
   ├── LEFT JOIN to get summary data for each statement
   └── Returns JSON with:
       ├── balance_match
       ├── verification_status
       └── verification_reason

3. Frontend JavaScript (index.html):
   ├── Fetches data from /api/v1/unified-list
   ├── For each item, calls helper functions:
   │   ├── getBalanceMatchBadge(item) → renders Success/Failed badge
   │   ├── getVerificationBadge(item) → renders PASS/FAIL/WARNING badge
   │   └── getVerificationReason(item) → renders truncated text with tooltip
   └── Dynamically builds table rows with all columns
```

## Advantages of Separate Column

1. **Immediate Visibility**: Users can see verification reasons without hovering
2. **Scanability**: Easy to scan the table for specific verification issues
3. **Accessibility**: Better than tooltip-only approach (accessible to screen readers)
4. **Space Management**: Smart truncation keeps table width manageable
5. **Full Details**: Tooltip still available for complete text

## Testing

```bash
✅ App imports successfully
✅ JavaScript syntax validated
✅ All 22 columns properly aligned
```

## User Testing Instructions

1. **Start the server:**
   ```bash
   ./start.sh
   ```

2. **Navigate to main page** (http://localhost:8000)

3. **Verify new columns appear in the statements table:**
   - ✅ "Balance Match" column between "Actions" and "Verification"
   - ✅ "Verification Reason" column between "Verification" and "Duplicates"

4. **Check unprocessed statements:**
   - Balance Match: "Not Processed" (gray)
   - Verification: "-" (gray)
   - Verification Reason: "-" (gray)

5. **Process a statement** using the "Process" button

6. **Check processed statement display:**
   - ✅ Balance Match shows "Success" (green) or "Failed" (red)
   - ✅ Verification shows "PASS" (green), "FAIL" (red), or "WARNING" (yellow)
   - ✅ Verification Reason shows actual text
   - ✅ Long messages are truncated with "..."
   - ✅ Hover over truncated text shows full message in tooltip

## Expected Results

For a processed statement with balance match:
```
| Balance Match | Verification | Verification Reason                        |
|---------------|--------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Success       | PASS         | Balance matches and no duplicates detected |
```

For a balance mismatch:
```
| Balance Match | Verification | Verification Reason                        |
|---------------|--------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Failed        | FAIL         | Balance mismatch: calculated=1050000.00... |
```
(Hover over truncated text to see full message: "Balance mismatch: calculated=1050000.00, statement=1049950.00")

For duplicates detected:
```
| Balance Match | Verification | Verification Reason                |
|---------------|--------------|-----------------------------------|
| Success       | WARNING      | Found 3 duplicate transactions     |
```

For unprocessed statement:
```
| Balance Match | Verification | Verification Reason |
|---------------|--------------|---------------------|
| Not Processed | -            | -                   |
```
