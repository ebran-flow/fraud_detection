**For:** Management Meeting

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL FINDINGS

### Overall Impact
- **146 FATAL customers** identified with confirmed borrower records
- **3,717 total loans** disbursed to these fraudulent customers
- **NET LOSS: 111.6M UGX** (Revenue: 84.8M | Outstanding: 196.3M)

---

## 💰 FINANCIAL IMPACT

| Metric | Amount (UGX) | Amount (Billion) |
|--------|-------------|------------------|
| **Outstanding Amount** | 196,333,400 | 0.20B |
| **Revenue Collected** | 84,764,200 | 0.08B |
| **Net Loss** | **(111,569,200)** | **(0.11B)** |

### Risk Assessment
- **Current Outstanding > Revenue Collected**
- Loss represents potential unrecoverable amount from fraudulent customers
- 40 customers currently have overdue loans

---

## 📊 CUSTOMER BEHAVIOR

### Payment Performance (3,584 paid loans)
- **96.7%** paid on time (≤1 day late): 3,466 loans
- **3.3%** paid late (>1 day): 118 loans

**Key Insight:** Despite being fraud cases, these customers have excellent payment records (96.7% on-time). This suggests:
1. Fraud used to access loans initially
2. Customers may be legitimate businesses using falsified statements to bypass verification
3. Not traditional "take money and run" fraud

### Current Status
- **64 customers** with ongoing loans (active borrowers)
- **40 customers** with overdue loans (high risk)
- Majority are still engaged with the platform

|------|---------|-------------------|------------------|
| 1 | *(Unknown/System)* | 1,758 | 89 |
