## Technical Implementation

**Loan Buckets Defined:**
```python
0-500K:   amount <= 500,000
500K-1M:  500,000 < amount <= 1,000,000
1M-2M:    1,000,000 < amount <= 2,000,000
2M-5M:    2,000,000 < amount <= 5,000,000
5M+:      amount > 5,000,000
```

**Calculation Method:**
1. Each loan assigned to bucket based on loan_principal
2. Customer's loans summed within each bucket
3. Customer's status applied to their total in that bucket
4. Aggregated across all customers per bucket
