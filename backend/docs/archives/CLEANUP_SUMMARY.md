# Project Cleanup Summary

**Date:** October 11, 2025
**Performed by:** Claude Code Assistant

## Overview

This cleanup was performed to reduce clutter and organize the project structure after migrating from Streamlit to FastAPI + HTMX, and implementing multi-provider support with factory pattern.

## Actions Taken

### 1. Created Organization Folders

- **`statements/`** - For CSV/Excel data files and mapper files
- **`docs/`** - For all documentation and README files
- **`archived_old_code/`** - For old scripts that are no longer used (to be zipped)

### 2. Moved Data Files

Moved to `statements/` folder:
- `mapper.csv` - Account mapping data
- `test_68b5699446f1e_comparison.csv` - Test comparison data

### 3. Moved Documentation Files

Moved to `docs/` folder:
- `TECHNICAL_DOCUMENTATION.md`
- `README.old.md`
- `SETUP_GUIDE.md`
- `DATABASE_MIGRATION.md`
- `EDGE_CASE_ANALYSIS.md`
- `MIGRATION_GUIDE.md`
- `GOOGLE_SHEETS_SETUP.md`
- `MULTI_PROVIDER_IMPLEMENTATION.md`
- `QUICKSTART.md`
- `ARCHIVED_FILES_README.md`
- `MULTI_PROVIDER_GUIDE.md`
- `UMTN_VS_UATL_COMPARISON.md`
- `README_NEW.md`

**Kept in root:**
- `README.md` - Main project README (primary entry point)

### 4. Archived Old Backup Files

Created compressed archive: **`archived_backups_20251011_222435.zip`** (87KB)

Archived files:
- `app.py.backup` - Old Streamlit app backup
- `app.py.backup_20251010_231337` - Older Streamlit app backup
- `app.py.old` - Another Streamlit app version
- `process_statements.py.backup_20251010_231304` - Legacy parser backup
- `format2_context.txt` - Old format context notes
- `archived_unused_files_20251011_210717.zip` - Previously created archive

### 5. Archived Obsolete Shell Scripts

Created compressed archive: **`archived_scripts_20251011_222628.zip`** (296 bytes)

Archived:
- `run_app.sh` - Old script referencing wrong directory and Streamlit app

**Kept (actively used):**
- `setup.sh` - Sets up virtual environment and dependencies for FastAPI app
- `start.sh` - Starts the FastAPI application with uvicorn

**Note:** The following old active files were already removed in previous cleanup sessions:
- Old Streamlit app files (`streamlit_ui.py`, `app.py`)
- Legacy parser scripts (`process_statements.py`, `fraud.py`)
- Debug scripts (`debug_*.py` files)
- Old batch processing scripts (`batch_process_statements.py`)
- Legacy utilities (`mapper.py`, `config.py`, etc.)
- Old backend services:
  - `backend/app/services/parser.py` (replaced by parsers directory)
  - `backend/app/services/crud.py` (replaced by `crud_v2.py`)

## Key Functions in Active Code

All functions in `backend/app/services/processor.py` are actively used:

1. **`process_statement()`** - Main processing entry point
2. **`detect_duplicates()`** - Duplicate detection based on txn_id + date + amount + description
3. **`detect_special_transactions()`** - Detects commissions, reversals, rollbacks
4. **`optimize_same_timestamp_transactions()`** - Reorders same-timestamp transactions (Format 1)
5. **`calculate_running_balance()`** - Calculates running balance with signed/unsigned amount detection
6. **`generate_summary()`** - Creates summary record
7. **`batch_process_statements()`** - Processes multiple statements

## What Was Not Archived (Still Needed)

### Parser Dependencies

The current parsers (`backend/app/services/parsers/uatl_parser.py`) may still import from old root-level scripts like `process_statements.py` and `fraud.py`. However, these files no longer exist, which means:

**Action Required:** If the parsers fail, the import statements need to be updated or the old scripts need to be restored temporarily.

## Format Types Currently Supported

- **Format 1 PDF**: Unsigned amounts, Credit/Debit column, fees separate
- **Format 1 CSV**: Signed amounts (based on Credit/Debit column during import), fees may be separate
- **Format 2**: Signed amounts, no Credit/Debit column

**Format 3 was removed** - It was an incorrect approach to handle CSV separately.

## Key Technical Changes Made in Previous Session

1. **Provider Selection UI** - Added dropdown to explicitly select UATL (Airtel) or UMTN (MTN)
2. **CSV Format 1 Support** - Signs amounts during import based on Credit/Debit column
3. **Fee Handling** - Detects CSV vs PDF by checking if amounts are signed
4. **Same-Timestamp Optimization** - Applied permutation testing to Format 1 (was only in Format 2)
5. **Duplicate Detection Fix** - Now checks txn_id to avoid false duplicates

## Recommendations

1. **Update Parser Imports** - Check if `uatl_parser.py` still needs old root-level scripts
2. **Remove Empty Archive** - Since `archived_old_code/` is empty, consider removing it or documenting why it's empty
3. **Consolidate Documentation** - Many similar README files exist; consider merging into single comprehensive docs

## File Counts

- **Statements folder:** 2 files
- **Docs folder:** 13 markdown files
- **Archived folder:** 0 files (already cleaned previously)
- **Active Python modules:** ~35 files in backend/

## Next Steps

If you need to restore any old functionality:
1. Check git history for the deleted files
2. Old files should be in previous commits (before October 11, 2025)
3. Reference commit: 923f9e0 (latest before cleanup)
