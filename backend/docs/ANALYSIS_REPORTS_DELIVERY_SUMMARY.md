## Scripts Created

### Script 1: export_unified_statements.py
**Location:** `scripts/analysis/export_unified_statements.py`
**Purpose:** Export all statements grouped by format
**Runtime:** ~30 seconds
**Usage:**
```bash
python scripts/analysis/export_unified_statements.py
```

### Script 2: export_fatal_analysis.py
**Location:** `scripts/analysis/export_fatal_analysis.py`
**Purpose:** FATAL analysis with loans data and insights
**Runtime:** ~2 minutes
**Usage:**
```bash
python scripts/analysis/export_fatal_analysis.py
```

---

## Technical Implementation

### Data Sources
- **fraud_detection.unified_statements** - Statement data
- **fraud_detection.customer_details** - Customer and borrower info
- **flow_api.loans** - Loan history
- **flow_api.app_users** - User accounts (CS identification)
- **flow_api.persons** - Person names

### Key Logic Implemented

**overdue_days Calculation:**
```sql
DATEDIFF(COALESCE(paid_date, NOW()), due_date) as overdue_days_calc
```

**Payment Performance Buckets:**
- `tot_ontime_count`: overdue_days ≤ 1 AND paid_date IS NOT NULL
- `tot_3_day_late_loans`: overdue_days > 3 AND paid_date IS NOT NULL
- `tot_10_day_late_loans`: overdue_days ≥ 10 AND paid_date IS NOT NULL

**Current Risk:**
- `tot_overdue_loans`: status = 'overdue' (snapshot)
- `tot_os_amount`: SUM(os_amount) WHERE status IN ('ongoing', 'overdue')

**Most Frequent RM:**
- Mode calculation using Counter
- If tie, picks first alphabetically

**Last Loan Status:**
- Status of loan with MAX(disbursal_date)

---

## Data Quality Notes

### Handled Edge Cases
- **FATAL statements without cust_id:** Excluded from loan analysis (140 statements)
- **Customers without loans:** Show 0 for loan metrics
- **Missing RM/CS names:** Shown as NULL/empty
- **Decimal conversions:** os_amount and flow_fee converted to float

### Coverage
- **146 / 286 FATAL statements** (51%) have cust_id match
- **100% of those 146** have loan history (3,718 loans)
- **10,555 total customer records** in analysis_raw (includes all borrowers)
- **146 FATAL customers** filtered in insights

---

## Usage Instructions

### Opening Excel Files
1. Navigate to `docs/analysis/`
2. Open with Excel, LibreOffice, or Google Sheets
3. Each tab is formatted with:
   - Auto-adjusted column widths
   - Frozen header row
   - Sorted by relevance

### Re-running Reports
```bash
# Export all statements
python scripts/analysis/export_unified_statements.py

# Export FATAL analysis
python scripts/analysis/export_fatal_analysis.py
```

Both scripts are idempotent - safe to run multiple times.

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. **Review FATAL cases** - Use `FATAL_filtered` tab
2. **Contact overdue customers** - 40 customers from `business_impact` tab
3. **RM Training** - Top 3 RMs from `RM_Submitted` tab
4. **CS Investigation** - High-volume single-customer relationships from `CS_Analysis` tab

### Analysis Opportunities
5. **Revenue Recovery** - Use `os_vs_revenue` tab to prioritize collection
6. **Trend Monitoring** - Track `monthly_trends` for new patterns
7. **RM Performance** - Compare `RM_Submitted` vs `RM_Registered` vs `RM_Overdue_Disbursals`

### System Improvements
8. **Automated Alerts** - Flag new FATAL submissions in real-time
9. **RM Dashboards** - Individual RM fraud rate tracking
10. **Predictive Model** - Identify fraud patterns before disbursal
