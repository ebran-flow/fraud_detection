## Technical Implementation

### Data Sources
- **analysis_raw:** Customer-level aggregations (tot_loans, last_loan_status, days_since_last_loan)
- **loans_raw:** Individual loan records (loan_principal, overdue_days_calc, paid_date)

### Calculations

**Total Exposure per Customer:**
```python
total_disbursed = loans_df.groupby('cust_id')['loan_principal'].sum()
```

**By Last Loan Status:**
```python
exposure_ongoing = customers[customers['last_loan_status'].isin(['ongoing', 'due'])]['total_disbursed'].sum()
```

**Historical Payment:**
```python
ontime_amount = paid_loans[paid_loans['overdue_days_calc'] <= 1]['loan_principal'].sum()
late_amount = paid_loans[paid_loans['overdue_days_calc'] > 1]['loan_principal'].sum()
```
