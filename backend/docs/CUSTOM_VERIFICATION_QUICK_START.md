# Custom Verification System - Quick Start Guide

## Overview
The custom verification system automatically classifies Airtel statements into fraud risk levels based on PDF metadata patterns.

**Verification Levels:**
- ðŸŸ¢ **NO_ISSUES** - Verified statements, safe to process
- ðŸŸ¡ **WARNING** - Minor concerns, review recommended
- ðŸŸ  **CRITICAL** - Significant anomalies, investigation required
- ðŸ”´ **FATAL** - Strong fraud indicators, immediate action needed

---

## Quick Access: View Verification Status

### Option 1: Web Interface (Recommended)
Access the unified_statements view through your database client with this filter:
```sql
SELECT * FROM unified_statements
WHERE acc_prvdr_code = 'UATL'
ORDER BY custom_verification, balance_diff_change_ratio DESC;
```

### Option 2: Export Data Files
Pre-generated CSV files available in `docs/data/`:
- **Flagged cases:** `flagged_statements_fatal_critical.csv` (288 records)
- **Verified cases:** `verified_statements_no_issues.csv` (2,164 records)

## Running Classification

### Manual Classification Run
To re-run classification after updates:
```bash
cd /home/ebran/Developer/projects/airtel_fraud_detection/backend
python scripts/analysis/apply_custom_verification.py
```

### Dry Run (Preview Only)
To preview classification without updating database:
```bash
python scripts/analysis/apply_custom_verification.py --dry-run
```

**Execution Time:** ~2 minutes for 12,405 statements

## Understanding Fraud Patterns

### Pattern 1: Microsoft Office Editing (Most Common)
**Indicators:**
- meta_producer contains "MicrosoftÂ® Word" or "MicrosoftÂ® Excel"
- Often combined with header_row_manipulation_count > 0

**Example:**
```
Producer: MicrosoftÂ® Word 2013
Author: AIRTEL UGANDA or USER
Created: 2025-03-12 17:00:46
Modified: 2025-03-12 17:00:46
Header Manipulations: 36 times
Balance Diff: 31.03%
```

**Action:** Contact customer immediately, verify original statement

---

### Pattern 2: Modified Qt 4.8.7 PDFs (Sophisticated)
**Indicators:**
- meta_producer = "Qt 4.8.7" (genuine Airtel producer)
- meta_modified_at is NOT NULL (modified after creation)
- High balance discrepancy

**Example:**
```
Producer: Qt 4.8.7
Author: N/A
Created: 2025-10-08 10:48:22
Modified: 2025-10-08 12:34:24 (2 hours later!)
Balance Diff: 89.34%
```

**Action:** Urgent review - sophisticated fraud attempt designed to look genuine

---

### Pattern 3: Header Row Manipulation
**Indicators:**
- header_row_manipulation_count > 0
- Format 2 statements
- Often combined with Microsoft Office producer

**Severity Levels:**
- 1-10 manipulations: Minor concern
- 11-30 manipulations: Moderate concern
- 31-50 manipulations: High concern (83% avg balance diff)
- 50+ manipulations: Severe manipulation

**Example:**
```
Header Manipulations: 46 times
Producer: MicrosoftÂ® Word 2013
Balance Diff: 29.34%
```

**Action:** Review for inserted rows between transactions

---

## Verification Override Rule

**Rule:** If `balance_match = 'Success'`, statement is automatically classified as `NO_ISSUES` regardless of metadata.

**Rationale:** Successfully verified balance calculations override metadata concerns. Even if metadata shows anomalies, if the numbers add up correctly, the statement is considered valid.

**Example:**
```sql
-- Statement has suspicious metadata but balance matches
Summary Table: custom_verification = NULL or FATAL
Balance Match: Success
View Output: custom_verification = NO_ISSUES
Reason: "Balance verification successful"
```

## Quick Decision Guide

### For RMs Submitting Statements

**Before Submission:**
1. Check PDF producer in document properties
2. Reject if shows Microsoft Word/Excel
3. Verify no modification timestamp
4. Check for unusual header rows

**After Flagged:**
1. Contact customer immediately
2. Request original statement from Airtel
3. Compare with submitted version
4. Document findings

---

### For Reviewers

**FATAL Case:**
1. Immediate investigation required
2. Freeze disbursement pending verification
3. Contact customer and RM
4. Document response
5. Escalate if customer confirms fraud

**CRITICAL Case:**
1. Review within 24 hours
2. Check additional metrics
3. Compare with previous statements
4. Consult supervisor if uncertain

**NO_ISSUES Case:**
1. Safe to proceed
2. Standard processing
3. No additional review needed

**UNCLASSIFIED Case:**
1. Check balance_diff_change_ratio
2. If < 5%: Likely genuine, proceed
3. If > 10%: Manual review recommended
4. If > 50%: Treat as CRITICAL

## Integration with Customer Details

### Check Fraud History for Customer
```sql
SELECT
    u.run_id,
    u.submitted_date,
    u.custom_verification,
    cd.borrower_biz_name,
    cd.tot_loans,
    cd.tot_default_loans,
    cd.risk_category
FROM unified_statements u
LEFT JOIN customer_details cd ON u.run_id = cd.run_id
WHERE u.acc_number = 'CUSTOMER_ACC_NUMBER'
ORDER BY u.submitted_date DESC;
```

### High-Risk Borrowers with Fraud History
```sql
SELECT
    cd.borrower_biz_name,
    cd.cust_id,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN u.custom_verification = 'FATAL' THEN 1 END) as fatal_count,
    cd.tot_loans,
    cd.tot_default_loans,
    cd.risk_category,
    cd.current_fa_limit
FROM customer_details cd
INNER JOIN unified_statements u ON cd.run_id = u.run_id
WHERE u.custom_verification = 'FATAL'
GROUP BY cd.borrower_biz_name, cd.cust_id, cd.tot_loans, cd.tot_default_loans,
         cd.risk_category, cd.current_fa_limit
HAVING fatal_count >= 2
ORDER BY fatal_count DESC, cd.tot_default_loans DESC;
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Column not found
**Problem:** custom_verification column doesn't exist in unified_statements view
**Solution:** Apply migration:
```bash
mysql -u root -p fraud_detection < migrations/add_custom_verification_to_unified_view.sql
```

### Issue: Outdated classifications
**Problem:** New statements not classified
**Solution:** Run classification script:
```bash
python scripts/analysis/apply_custom_verification.py
```

### Issue: Can't update view
**Problem:** Permission denied when updating view
**Solution:** Use xtrabackup credentials (root user) from `.env.xtrabackup`
