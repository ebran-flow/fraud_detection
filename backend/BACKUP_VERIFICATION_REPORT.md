## Issues Fixed During Verification

### 1. Restore Script Configuration ❌ → ✅

**Problem:** The restore script was still configured for Docker MySQL
**Impact:** Would have failed if restoration was attempted
**Fixed:** Updated `/home/ebran/Developer/projects/airtel_fraud_detection/backend/scripts/backup/xtrabackup_restore.sh`

**Changes Made:**
- ❌ `docker stop mysql` → ✅ `sudo systemctl stop mysql`
- ❌ `/var/lib/docker/volumes/docker_config_dbdata/_data` → ✅ `/var/lib/mysql`
- ❌ `chown 999:999` → ✅ `chown mysql:mysql`

## How to Restore if Database Gets Dropped

### Quick Restore (Emergency):

```bash
cd /home/ebran/Developer/projects/airtel_fraud_detection/backend
sudo ./scripts/backup/xtrabackup_restore.sh
```

**What it does:**
1. ⚠️ Stops MySQL service
2. 📦 Backs up current data directory to `/var/lib/mysql_backup_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS`
3. 📂 Decompresses the latest full backup
4. 🔧 Prepares backup (applies transaction logs)
5. 📋 Copies restored files to `/var/lib/mysql`
6. 🔐 Fixes permissions
7. ▶️ Starts MySQL service
8. ✅ Verifies database restoration

**Time Required:** ~15-30 minutes (depends on backup size)

### Manual Restore (Step-by-Step):

1. **List available backups:**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/backup/list_backups.sh
   ```

2. **Verify backup before restore:**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/backup/quick_verify_backup.sh
   ```

3. **Perform restore:**
   ```bash
   sudo ./scripts/backup/xtrabackup_restore.sh
   ```

4. **Verify restoration:**
   ```bash
   mysql -u root -ppassword fraud_detection -e "
   SELECT 'metadata' as table_name, COUNT(*) FROM metadata
   UNION ALL
   SELECT 'summary', COUNT(*) FROM summary
   UNION ALL
   SELECT 'uatl_raw', COUNT(*) FROM uatl_raw_statements;
   "
   ```

## Backup Strategy

### Current Setup:

**Full Backups:**
- Created manually or on-demand
- Retention: Keep last 4
- Size: ~8GB compressed
- Location: `/backups/xtrabackup/full/`

**Incremental Backups:**
- Based on last full backup
- Retention: 7 days
- Size: Variable (changes only)
- Location: `/backups/xtrabackup/incremental/`

### Recommended Schedule:

| Frequency | Type | Command |
|-----------|------|---------|
| Weekly | Full | `./scripts/backup/xtrabackup_full.sh` |
| Daily | Incremental | `./scripts/backup/xtrabackup_incremental.sh` |
| Before major changes | Full | `./scripts/backup/xtrabackup_full.sh` |

---

## Verification Commands

### Quick Check:
```bash
./scripts/backup/quick_verify_backup.sh
```
**Time:** ~5 seconds
**Purpose:** Verify backup structure without decompression

### Full Verification:
```bash
./scripts/backup/verify_backup.sh
```
**Time:** ~5-10 minutes
**Purpose:** Decompress and prepare backup to verify it can be restored

### List All Backups:
```bash
./scripts/backup/list_backups.sh
```
**Purpose:** View all backups with descriptions and metadata

---

## What's Included in Backups

### Database Schema:
- ✅ All tables (8 total)
- ✅ Indexes
- ✅ Foreign keys
- ✅ Table structure

### Data:
- ✅ metadata (~20,794 records)
- ✅ summary (~21,192 records)
- ✅ uatl_raw_statements (~32M rows)
- ✅ uatl_processed_statements (~35M rows)
- ✅ umtn_raw_statements (~28M rows)
- ✅ umtn_processed_statements (~28M rows)

### Note on Schema Changes:

The Oct 15 backup **does not include** recent schema additions:
- ❌ `metadata.header_rows_count` (added after backup)
- ❌ `summary.missing_days_detected` (added after backup)
- ❌ `uatl_raw_statements.amount_raw` (added after backup)
- ❌ `uatl_raw_statements.fee_raw` (added after backup)

**Solution:** After restore, run:
```bash
mysql -u root -ppassword fraud_detection < scripts/migration/post_restore_updates.sql
```

---

## Backup Credentials

**File:** `/home/ebran/Developer/projects/airtel_fraud_detection/backend/.env.xtrabackup`

```bash
BACKUP_DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
BACKUP_DB_PORT=3306
BACKUP_DB_USER=root
BACKUP_DB_PASSWORD=password
BACKUP_DB_NAME=fraud_detection
```

**Security:**
- ✅ File permissions: 600 (owner read/write only)
- ✅ In `.gitignore` (not committed to git)
- ✅ Separate from application credentials

---

## Testing & Validation

### What Was Tested:

1. ✅ Backup file structure
2. ✅ XtraBackup checkpoint validity
3. ✅ All required files present
4. ✅ All expected tables present
5. ✅ Restore script configuration
6. ✅ Backup size and compression

### What Can Be Tested (But Wasn't):

1. ⏳ Full decompress + prepare cycle (takes 5-10 minutes)
2. ⏳ Actual restore to test database
3. ⏳ Incremental backup restoration
4. ⏳ Point-in-time recovery

### Recommended Tests:

**Monthly:** Run full verification
```bash
./scripts/backup/verify_backup.sh
```

**Quarterly:** Test restore to a separate MySQL instance (not production)

## Disaster Recovery Checklist

### If Database Gets Dropped:

- [ ] Don't panic - you have 3 full backups
- [ ] Run quick verification: `./scripts/backup/quick_verify_backup.sh`
- [ ] Check which backup to use: `./scripts/backup/list_backups.sh`
- [ ] Stop application (if running)
- [ ] Run restore: `sudo ./scripts/backup/xtrabackup_restore.sh`
- [ ] Wait 15-30 minutes for restore to complete
- [ ] Verify data: Check row counts
- [ ] Apply schema updates: `mysql < scripts/migration/post_restore_updates.sql`
- [ ] Restart application
- [ ] Take new full backup immediately
