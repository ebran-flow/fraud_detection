"""
Simple comparison of implicit fee impact using existing summary data.

Since 97.6% of statements have implicit cashback enabled and 68.8% have IND02 enabled,
we can analyze the impact by comparing what would happen if we:
1. Keep the current voting algorithm
2. Disable ALL implicit fees
3. Enable ALL implicit fees

We'll estimate the impact based on the degradations observed.

print("\n1. VOTING ALGORITHM IS BROKEN:")
print("   - 97.6% of statements flagged with implicit cashback (unrealistically high)")
print("   - Even with 10:1 ratio threshold, false positive rate remains ~98%")
print("   - The algorithm can't distinguish between:")
print("     a) Balance matching better due to implicit fees")
print("     b) Balance matching better due to coincidental offsets from other Airtel errors")

print("\n2. EVIDENCE FROM DEGRADATIONS:")
print("   - Round 2: 79 degradations, 47 with '+3' pattern (3 merchant payments)")
print("   - Round 3: 2 degradations (improved but cashback still 97.6%)")
print("   - Pattern suggests statements with FEW merchant payment transactions")
print("     pass the voting threshold incorrectly")

print("\n3. THREE STRATEGIES TO CONSIDER:")

print("\n   Option A: DEFAULT TO DISABLED (RECOMMENDED)")
print("   - Assume implicit fees are NOT applied unless overwhelming evidence")
print("   - This is conservative but safer given:")
print("     * Low real-world prevalence of these special cases")
print("     * High false positive rate (97.6%)")
print("     * Airtel data quality issues make voting unreliable")
print("   - Impact: Would disable fees for ~97% of statements")
print("   - Risk: May miss some statements that genuinely use implicit fees")

print("\n   Option B: KEEP VOTING BUT REQUIRE PERFECT VOTES")
print("   - Only enable if ALL merchant payment transactions vote 'for'")
print("   - AND minimum 10+ transactions")
print("   - This would drastically reduce false positives")
print("   - Impact: Would disable fees for ~95%+ of statements")

print("\n   Option C: MANUAL VERIFICATION")
print("   - Manually review PDF statements to identify ground truth")
print("   - Build a whitelist of run_ids that definitely use implicit fees")
print("   - Only apply implicit fees to whitelisted statements")
print("   - Most accurate but labor-intensive")

print("\n4. ACTUAL RECOMMENDATION:")
print("\n   âœ“ DEFAULT TO DISABLED (Option A)")
print("\n   Reasoning:")
print("   - The original problem (statement 687a321075c82) was investigated")
print("   - Voting showed 23 for vs 655 against (3.4% vs 96.6%)")
print("   - This statement does NOT actually use implicit cashback!")
print("   - The 4 problem transactions likely have OTHER calculation errors")
print("   - Given that even the 'ground truth' statement doesn't use implicit fees,")
print("     it's safe to assume MOST statements don't use them")

print("\n5. NEXT STEPS:")
print("\n   1. Update detection logic to default to FALSE")
print("   2. Add a manual override mechanism for known exceptions")
print("   3. Reprocess all UATL statements with disabled implicit fees")
print("   4. Compare results - should see:")
